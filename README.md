# Create Clash Royale Emotes using MediaPipe


This project watches your webcam and recognizes a few very specific **face + hand “emotes”**. When an emote is detected and sustained, it can fire an action (play a video, send a hotkey, trigger a script, etc.).  
No training, no cloud — just landmarks + geometry.
